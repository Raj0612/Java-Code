//We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
//I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
//Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.
//You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:
/*    1. -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
    2. 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
    3. 0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).*/
//Return the number that I picked.

/*Example 1:
        Input: n = 10, pick = 6
        Output: 6
Example 2:
        Input: n = 1, pick = 1
        Output: 1
Example 3:
        Input: n = 2, pick = 1
        Output: 1*/
