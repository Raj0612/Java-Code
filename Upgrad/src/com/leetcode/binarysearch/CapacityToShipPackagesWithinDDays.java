//A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within D days.
///The ith package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i]. Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights).
// We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
//Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within D days.

/*Example 1:
        Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], days = 5
        Output: 15
        Explanation: A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
        1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
        2nd day: 6, 7
        3rd day: 8
        4th day: 9
        5th day: 10
        Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts
        like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed.
Example 2:
        Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], days = 3
        Output: 6
        Explanation: A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
        1st day: 3, 2
        2nd day: 2, 4
        3rd day: 1, 4*/
